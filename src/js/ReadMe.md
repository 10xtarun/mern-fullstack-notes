# JavaScript Basics

> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive client-side web applications, but it can also be used on the server-side through NodeJS. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, who was then working at Netscape Communications Corporation.

## Core features of JavaScript

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the creation of objects with their own properties and methods. Objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are used extensively in the language.

2. Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable can change at runtime. This makes JavaScript very flexible and easy to use.

3. First-Class Functions: JavaScript functions are first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed around like any other data type. Functions can also be used as arguments to other functions, and they can be returned as values from functions.

4. Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which means that it can execute multiple operations simultaneously without blocking the execution of other code. This is typically used in web applications to make requests to servers without blocking the UI.

5. Prototypal Inheritance: JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, which is a different approach to inheritance than classical inheritance used in languages like Java and C++. This allows for more flexible object creation and is a key feature of the language.

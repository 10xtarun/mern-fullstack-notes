By adopting the pedagogy of learning by doing, we aim to bring innovation right into the educational structure at the edba academy. Beyond sharing lectures, books, and notes, our multi-skilled and industry-focused programs encourage students to apply their knowledge to real-life situations, personalizing the learning experience.

Our skill development courses are created to bridge the existing skill gap among the Indian youth while meeting the future skill requirements of various industries. With the whole community functioning as a learning ground, students are encouraged to develop a problem-solving mindset, widening their future career prospects and earning capacity.

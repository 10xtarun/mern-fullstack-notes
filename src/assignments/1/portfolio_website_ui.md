# Portfolio Using HTML and CSS

## Introduction

Building a portfolio website is a great way to showcase your skills, projects, and achievements to potential employers or clients. In this project, we'll walk through the steps to create a simple portfolio website using HTML and CSS.

### Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

### Project Overview

We'll create a portfolio website with multiple sections, including:

* Home (Introduction)
* About Me
* Projects
* Contact
* Each section will have its own layout and content to showcase different aspects of your portfolio.

### Steps to Build the Portfolio

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new folder for your project and set up the basic structure with the following files:

index.html: Main HTML file.
styles.css: CSS stylesheet for styling.

### Step 2: Design the Layout

Define the layout of your portfolio website using HTML. Use semantic HTML elements to structure different sections of the website, such as `<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>`. You can also include links to external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for faster development.

### Step 3: Style Your Portfolio

Apply CSS styles to make your portfolio visually appealing. Use CSS for layout, typography, colors, and spacing. You can create custom styles or use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma for pre-designed components and layouts.

### Step 4: Populate Content

Add content to each section of your portfolio, including information about yourself, your skills, projects you've worked on, and how to contact you. Use headings, paragraphs, lists, and images to organize and present your content effectively.

### Step 5: Test and Refine

Test your portfolio website across different devices and web browsers to ensure that it looks and functions correctly. Make any necessary adjustments to improve the overall user experience and responsiveness of the website.

Example Code:
HTML (index.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section id="home">
            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>

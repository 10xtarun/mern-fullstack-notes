# Backend Development: The Node, The Express And The API

## Introduction to backend

> We need a backend to handle all the behind-the-scenes work of a website or application. It's like the engine of a car – you don't see it, but it powers everything.

Backend is needed for tasks like:

* Storing and retrieving data from databases.
* Processing and handling user requests.
* Implementing business logic and rules.
* Managing security and user authentication.
* Integrating with other services and APIs.

> In short, the backend makes sure that everything works smoothly and efficiently, allowing the frontend to focus on providing a great user experience.

## Why do we need backend?

Let's explain the concept of backend in layman's terms:

* Imagine you're visiting a restaurant. The frontend is like the menu you're given to choose your food from. It's nicely designed, colorful, and easy to read. You pick what you want to eat and give your order to the waiter.

* Now, the waiter takes your order to the kitchen, where all the cooking happens. The kitchen is like the backend of a website or application. It's where the magic really happens. The chefs (or backend developers) receive your order, prepare the food, and then send it back out to you.

* Similarly, in the world of technology, the frontend is what you see and interact with on your screen – the buttons, images, and text. But when you click a button or submit a form, that information needs to be processed, saved, or retrieved from somewhere. That's where the backend comes in.

* The backend consists of servers, databases, and applications that work behind the scenes to make everything happen. It's responsible for processing your requests, handling data, and sending responses back to the frontend.

* So, in simple terms, we need a backend to handle the "cooking" – processing requests, managing data, and making sure everything runs smoothly – so that the frontend can focus on looking good and providing a great user experience.

# What are list tags in HTML?

In HTML, a list is a type of element used to represent a collection of items in a structured format. Lists are commonly used to organize and present information in a structured and easy-to-read manner. 

## There are three main types of lists in HTML:

* Ordered List (`<ol>`):

An ordered list is a list of items where each item is preceded by a number or letter to indicate its order. Ordered lists are typically used when the order of items is important or meaningful.

Example:
```html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

Output:
```
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
```

* Unordered List (`<ul>`):

An unordered list is a list of items where each item is preceded by a bullet point or other marker to indicate its presence in the list. Unordered lists are typically used when the order of items is not important.

Example:
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

Output:
```
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
```

* Definition List (`<dl>`):

A definition list is a list of terms and their corresponding definitions. Each term is represented using a `<dt>` (definition term) element, and each definition is represented using a `<dd>` (definition description) element.

Example:
```html
<dl>
    <dt>Term 1</dt>
    <dd>Definition 1</dd>
    <dt>Term 2</dt>
    <dd>Definition 2</dd>
    <dt>Term 3</dt>
    <dd>Definition 3</dd>
</dl>
```

Output:
```
Term 1
: Definition 1

Term 2
: Definition 2

Term 3
: Definition 3
```

> These are the three main types of lists in HTML, each serving a specific purpose in organizing and presenting information on a webpage.

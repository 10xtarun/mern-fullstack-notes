# Introduction to CSS

## What is CSS?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents. CSS allows web developers to control the appearance of web pages, including elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. By separating the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), CSS enables consistent styling across multiple web pages and simplifies the process of updating and maintaining the visual design of a website.

## History of CSS:

* CSS1 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 1): CSS1 was the first version of CSS released in 1996. It introduced basic styling capabilities such as font properties, color, margins, padding, and background properties. CSS1 lacked support for many advanced features and layout techniques.

* CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 2): CSS2 was released in 1998 and introduced more advanced styling features, including positioning, floating elements, and absolute and relative positioning. CSS2 also introduced support for media types and generated content.

* CSS2.1: CSS2.1 is a revision of CSS2 that addresses inconsistencies and clarifies the specification. It was published as a W3C Recommendation in 2011 and serves as the foundation for modern CSS implementations.

> These previous versions of CSS laid the groundwork for the development of modern CSS, which continues to evolve with new features and capabilities.

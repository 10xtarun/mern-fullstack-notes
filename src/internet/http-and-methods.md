# What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web. It is an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. When you enter a URL into your web browser, the browser uses HTTP to communicate with the server and retrieve the web page you requested.

# What is HTTPS?

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption to secure the data transmitted between the user's browser and the website. This encryption is typically provided by Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The use of HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as login credentials and payment details, from eavesdroppers.

# What are common HTTP Methods?

HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, indicate the action to be performed on the resource identified by the URL. Here are some common HTTP methods:

* GET:

    * Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.
    * Example: Requesting a webpage or an image.

* POST:

    * Purpose: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
    * Example: Submitting a form with user input.

* PUT:

    * Purpose: Update a resource or create a new resource if it does not exist.
    * Example: Updating a user's profile information.

* DELETE:

    * Purpose: Delete a specified resource.
    * Example: Deleting a user account or a file.

* PATCH:

    * Purpose: Apply partial modifications to a resource.
    * Example: Modifying specific fields of a resource without affecting the entire resource.

These HTTP methods provide a way for clients (such as browsers) to interact with servers in various ways, allowing for the retrieval, submission, modification, and deletion of resources.
